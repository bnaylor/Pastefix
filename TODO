Event capture:

  The event capturing stuff in prefs is hackish.  I very nearly got a much nicer version working,
  where it just detected all the modifier flags for you, but I never could get the Cmd key to be 
  processed.  The reason there is still a button-based capture rather than just a text entry field
  is that it is relatively impossible (and discouraged by Apple) to work backwards from a character 
  to a virtual key code.
  
  It *should* be possible to capture command keystrokes without subclassing NSApp, but I give up
  for now.  Everything I could find said I just needed to make my responder a subclass of NSWindow
  and trap -performKeyEquivalent but that just didn't roll.
  
  What's there now is a little messy thanks to all the various hoops I jumped through earlier..
