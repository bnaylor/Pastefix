Redo the whole thing from scratch.

New features:

1. Design: the whole thing is just going to be a framework for feeding text
   into a modification pipeline, probably Python bindings?  Let the user
   define their own set of actions to take on text (provide some classic
   starter ones like strip newlines, word wrap, IRC wrap, iconv, etc.)..

   They can name them, edit the code, and set bindings for these actions.

   Actions should be saved as python(?) scripts in ~/.Pastefix/scripts/.. and
   discovered automatically.  Edits to them in the app should at least be able
   to check syntax.

2. Other ideas for converters:
  - strip html/xml tags out
  - cos wants to optionally preserve special formatting.  i never worked with that at all..

3. Multi-clipboard support:
  - undo stack for edits
  - n stacked pastebuffers each with their own undo stack.  every time you copy, the stack shifts up
    to some configurable limit.
  - navigate up and down the stack with keystrokes, edit, paste into document

4. Atext clone.  Optionally toggle accessibility and do text expansion.

5. Redo icon completely at 512px and other variants :/
